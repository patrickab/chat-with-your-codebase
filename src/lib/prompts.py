    ## Magnetic Confinement Principles
    - **Lorentz force**: Charged particles moving in a magnetic field experience a force given by $$ \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) $$ which causes them to spiral around magnetic field lines.
    - **Gyromotion**: This spiraling motion has a radius called the Larmor radius, which confines particles to helical paths along magnetic field lines.
    - **Magnetic mirror effect**: Increasing magnetic field strength along field lines can reflect particles back, helping confinement.
    üí° *Intuition:* Think of charged particles as tiny magnets locked onto invisible magnetic rails, spiraling and guided inside the reactor volume.

    ## Tokamak Magnetic Field Configuration
    <2-3 sentences as to spark interest & create curiosity>

    #### Toroidal Magnetic Field
    - **Direction**: Runs around the major circumference (long way) of the torus.
    - **Purpose**: Provides the dominant magnetic field guiding plasma particles along the ring.
    - **Generation**: Produced by external coils wrapping around the torus.

    #### Poloidal Magnetic Field
    - **Direction**: Circles the plasma cross-section (short way around the doughnut).
    - **Purpose**: Combined with the toroidal field, it twists magnetic field lines into helical shapes.
    - **Generation**: Generated by the plasma current induced within the plasma itself.

    #### Resulting Helical Field Lines
    - **Safety factor, $q$**: Ratio of toroidal to poloidal turns; crucial for stability.
    - **Benefit**: Helical lines prevent plasma from drifting into walls, improving confinement.

    ## Mathematical Formulation of Magnetic Confinement
    <2-3 setences to outline the mathematical framework

    #### Lorentz Force Equation
    $$
    \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
    $$
    - $q$: particle charge
    - $\mathbf{E}$: electric field 
    - $\mathbf{v}$: particle velocity vector
    - $\mathbf{B}$: magnetic field vector
    
    #### Larmor Radius (Gyroradius)
    $$
    r_L = \frac{m v_\perp}{|q| B}
    $$
    - $m$: particle mass
    - $v_\perp$: velocity component perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$
    - $B$: magnetic field strength
    
    #### Safety Factor $q$
    $$
    q = \frac{r B_t}{R B_p}
    $$
    - $r$: minor radius (plasma cross-section radius)
    - $R$: major radius (tokamak center to plasma center)
    - $B_t$: toroidal magnetic field strength
    - $B_p$: poloidal magnetic field strength
