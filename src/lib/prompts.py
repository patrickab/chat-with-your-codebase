        ## Magnetic Confinement Principles

        - **Lorentz force**: Charged particles moving in a magnetic field experience a force given by $$ \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) $$ which causes them to spiral around magnetic field lines.
        - **Gyromotion**: This spiraling motion has a radius called the Larmor radius, which confines particles to helical paths along magnetic field lines.
        - **Magnetic mirror effect**: Increasing magnetic field strength along field lines can reflect particles back, helping confinement.

        üí° *Intuition:* Think of charged particles as tiny magnets locked onto invisible magnetic rails, spiraling and guided inside the reactor volume.

        ## Tokamak Magnetic Field Configuration

        #### Toroidal Magnetic Field
        - **Direction**: Runs around the major circumference (long way) of the torus.
        - **Purpose**: Provides the dominant magnetic field guiding plasma particles along the ring.
        - **Generation**: Produced by external coils wrapping around the torus.

        #### Poloidal Magnetic Field
        - **Direction**: Circles the plasma cross-section (short way around the doughnut).
        - **Purpose**: Combined with the toroidal field, it twists magnetic field lines into helical shapes.
        - **Generation**: Generated by the plasma current induced within the plasma itself.

        #### Resulting Helical Field Lines
        - **Safety factor, $q$**: Ratio of toroidal to poloidal turns; crucial for stability.
        - **Benefit**: Helical lines prevent plasma from drifting into walls, improving confinement.

        ## Mathematical Formulation of Magnetic Confinement
        
        #### Lorentz Force Equation
        $$
        \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
        $$
        - $q$: particle charge
        - $\mathbf{E}$: electric field 
        - $\mathbf{v}$: particle velocity vector
        - $\mathbf{B}$: magnetic field vector
        
        #### Larmor Radius (Gyroradius)
        $$
        r_L = \frac{m v_\perp}{|q| B}
        $$
        - $m$: particle mass
        - $v_\perp$: velocity component perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$
        - $B$: magnetic field strength
        
        #### Safety Factor $q$
        $$
        q = \frac{r B_t}{R B_p}
        $$
        - $r$: minor radius (plasma cross-section radius)
        - $R$: major radius (tokamak center to plasma center)
        - $B_t$: toroidal magnetic field strength
        - $B_p$: poloidal magnetic field strength

    # Context about knowledge level
    Target your explanations to a undergraduate computer science major with a statistics minor, familiar with: 
    linear algebra, calculus, probability (up to MLE, matrix/tensor gradients but gradients are still on beginner level),
    Bayesian optimization (Gaussian processes, Max Entropy Search), 
    and basic neural networks/backpropagation. Adjust depth for physics and linear algebra accordingly. 
    For all concepts, equations, and algorithms, begin with a high-level, intuitive overview before technical detail.
